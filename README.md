# ParkiSense: A Parkinson's Disease Prediction System
## Overview
ParkiSense is a Parkinson's Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in patients using various biomedical voice measurements. The system employs advanced algorithms to analyze the data and provide accurate predictions, aiming to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Features
- Preprocessing of biomedical voice measurements
- Training and validation of machine learning models
- Prediction of Parkinson's disease presence
- Visualization of prediction results
- Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Parkinson's Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains biomedical voice measurements from patients with and without Parkinson's disease. The dataset can be downloaded from UCI Parkinson's Disease Dataset.
